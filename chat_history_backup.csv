Brief summary from the uploaded content:
- Phishing is the most common cyber threat; fraudulent messages aim to steal credentials.
- Over 90% of successful cyberattacks begin with a phishing email.
- It relies on social engineering rather than technical hacking.
- Key organizational steps: conduct regular phishing simulation exercises; update awareness training annually; enforce secure passwords and authentication policies; establish clear reporting channels; enforce least-privilege access controls.
- Reflection questions to boost readiness: identify phishing attempts; verify sender authenticity; use strong, unique passwords; enable MFA; know whom to report suspicious activity to.
- The material also references a Quick Quiz section related to phishing, and there’s related ransomware training in a separate document.
