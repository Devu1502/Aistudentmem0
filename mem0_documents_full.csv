Introduction and Why It Matters  Session cookies are small pieces of data that websites store in your browser to remember who you are while you interact with a site. When attackers steal these cookies, they can impersonate the user—accessing accounts, sensitive data, or corporate resources—without needing the password. Because cookies are a behind-the-scenes part of web browsing, their theft is often invisible to users, making it a serious and stealthy risk.  Stolen session cookies matter because they enable account takeover. An attacker with stolen cookies can bypass login protections and act as a legitimate user, requesting data, changing settings, or initiating transactions. For organizations, this can mean data breaches, compliance violations, and reputational damage.  2. Real-World Examples / Case Stories  Case 1: Social Media Account Takeovers  Attackers harvested session cookies from public WinFi hotspots and used them to take over highnprofile social media accounts. Once inside, they posted fraudulent messages and directed followers to malicious links, damaging brands and followers alike.",768,0.016879743;0.081863135;-0.19384715;0.02443759;0.09027175

Hospitals in the UK’s National Health Service were forced to cancel appointments, and the financial impact reached hundreds of millions of dollars. It spread through a Windows vulnerability, emphasizing the importance of timely system updates.  Case 2: The Colonial Pipeline Attack (2021) A single compromised password led to one of the most disruptive attacks in U.S. history. Fuel delivery across the East Coast was halted for days, creating shortages. The company paid $4.4 million in ransom, though part of it was later recovered by the FBI.  Case 3: Small Business Impact A local logistics firm with 25 employees fell victim to a ransomware email disguised as an invoice. Within hours, all operational data was encrypted. The company lost a week of productivity and nearly went bankrupt. This story shows ransomware can target anyone—no organization is too small to be a victim.  3.

Introduction and Why It Matters  Phishing is the most common and deceptive cyber threat targeting individuals and organizations alike. It involves fraudulent communication—often emails or messages—that appear to come from trusted sources. The goal is to trick users into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords, financial details, or login credentials. Globally, over 90% of successful cyberattacks begin with a phishing email, making awareness and training essential for every employee.  Phishing matters because it targets human psychology—curiosity, fear, or urgency. Unlike technical vulnerabilities, this type of attack relies on social engineering rather than hacking into systems.

Introduction and Why It Matters  Ransomware is one of the most pervasive and costly cyber threats of the 21st century. It is a form of malicious software that locks, encrypts, or restricts access to data and demands payment for its release. Attackers often target organizations that rely heavily on data continuity—such as hospitals, schools, and corporations—because downtime can be devastating. In 2024 alone, global damages caused by ransomware attacks exceeded $30 billion, highlighting the urgency of cybersecurity training for all employees.  Ransomware matters because it exploits the human element—the weakest link in cybersecurity. While advanced systems protect networks, a single careless click can lead to disaster. Understanding ransomware empowers employees to serve as the first line of defense, protecting both personal and organizational data integrity.  2.

(cid:127) Be mindful of USB devices: Avoid using unverified drives or media. (cid:127) Limit administrative privileges: Use a standard user account for daily work.  6. What to Do If It Happens  If you suspect ransomware infection, acting fast can minimize damage:  1. Disconnect from the internet immediately. 2. Notify your IT or cybersecurity team. 3. Do NOT pay the ransom—it encourages further attacks and may not guarantee recovery. 4. Document what happened (screenshots, ransom notes). 5. Restore data only from verified, clean backups. 6. Report the incident to law enforcement and cybersecurity authorities.  7. Policy Reminders / Organization Steps  Every organization should establish and follow clear cybersecurity policies.
